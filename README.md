Problem Statement

A book on the history of music contains a list of prominent composers with dates of their birth and death (or only birth date for the living ones). Find the most recent period of time (consecutive years) when the largest number of composers were alive.

For simplicity, a date contains only the year part and there are no negative years. A composer with either birth or death date on a particular year is assumed to be alive for that year. Some composers don't have death dates, just assume those to be alive in 1993 (the last year of the sample).

A sample list is attached as an ASCII file. Each line represents a different composer. You can assume that the data is valid and consistently formatted.
